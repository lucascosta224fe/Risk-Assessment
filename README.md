| Consequence  | Description                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Severe**        | Total loss of critical assets, complete system shutdown, irreversible damage, significant reputational harm, potential legal issues. |
| **Major**         | Significant partial loss of important assets or data, prolonged disruption, high financial loss, serious reputational damage.        |
| **Moderate**      | Manageable impact with recoverable data loss, moderate financial cost, temporary disruption.                                         |
| **Minor**         | Loss of non-critical information, minor operational effects, low financial cost.                                                     |
| **Insignificant** | No relevant loss, negligible impact on operations, reputation, or finances. Easily corrected.                                        |

| Likelihood         | Description                                                                            |
| :----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Rare**           | The event is highly unlikely to occur.                                                 |
| **Unlikely**       | The event may occur but is not expected.                                               |
| **Possible**       | There is a reasonable chance of the event occurring occasionally.                      |
| **Likely**         | The event is expected to occur regularly.                                              |
| **Almost Certain** | The event is very likely to occur.                                                     |


<h2>üì∞ Description:</h2>

The client wants to protect a server worth approximately R$20.000 that contains sensitive personal data (SPII) where the low fine is R$150.000. The SLE - Single Loss Expectancy is basically the Asset Value (AV) multiplied by the Exposure Factor (EF), therefore, if the EF is 100%,  that  is, losing everything, the total is: R$170.000 x 100% = R$170.000 And if it happens 5 times in a year = R$850.000. Therefore if the value of the security implementation is less or equal to the Anual Loss Expectancy, its worht to investing. Les assume the client lives in S√£o Paulo.
